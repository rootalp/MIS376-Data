Thanks to the data set I have found as a result of my research, 
I have been examining the gross domestic product values of the countries at certain time intervals since the day the coronavirus epidemic started. 
And create the necessary table.

In order to increase the data quality, I do not include the information in the dataset that will not contribute to my project.
In my first table, there are about 50,419 data covering the 10-month period from the start of the coronavirus epidemic and showing the gross domestic product values of all countries.
In order to improve the data quality, I simplified the data in my first table based on the conformity principle.
